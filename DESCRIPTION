Description: 
    Provides advanced tools for processing, deconvolution, and identification 
    of MS/MS spectral data. Includes functions for preprocessing spectra, 
    applying Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Alternating Least Squares (ALS), 
    and matching deconvoluted spectra against spectral libraries.
